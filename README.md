# RomanNumeralKata
A program developed using TDD to convert Arabic numbers to their Roman Numeral equivalents.

##Introduction
Roman Numerals are represented by letters.

- I = 1
- V = 5
- X = 10
- L = 50
- C = 100
- D = 500
- M = 1000

The letters representing "1"s (I, X, C, M) can be repeated up to three times.

e.g. II = 2, III = 3, XXX = 30, but IIII does not represent 4.

They can also be subtracted from letters representing the next two higher values, but only once.

e.g. IV = 4, IX = 9, XC = 90, but not IC or XXC.

The letters representing "5"s (V, L, D) can never be repeated, nor subtracted.

Values represented by the letters are added together to obtain the total value.

e.g. 
- VII = V + I + I = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7
- CXLV = C + XL + V = 100 + (50 - 10) + 5 = 145

These combination of letters and rules allow us to represent  numbers between 1 and 3999 inclusive.
